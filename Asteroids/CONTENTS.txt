	Asynchronously coupled model of ice loss, temperature, 
	and impact stirring on asteroids

asteroid_fast1.f90: (main program)
	Asynchronously coupled model of ice loss and temperature
	on asteroids; simplified version of asteroid_fast2

impactstirring.f90:
	Model of ice homogenization due to impact stirring,
	for use with "fast" model
