Lunar Ice Pump Model
====================

oscidea1.f90: (main program)
	ice pump calculations for one location; uses boundary-value formulation

oscidea_subs.f90:
	subroutines for ice pump calculations

subl_h2o.f90:
	set of functions for sublimation rate of H2O ice

subl_species.f90:
	sublimation rate of CO2 ice

bet.f90:
	BET adsorption isotherm of H2O

moon_subsdiff.f90: (main program)
	microphysical model of subsurface migration of H2O on airless bodies

moon_subsdiff_equilbr.f90: (main program)
	continuum model for equilibrium subsurface adsorbate concentrations
	matches time-averaged desorption rates at depth with those on surface

subsdiff_subs.f90:
	subroutines and functions for random-walk model of subsurface diffusion
	in lunar regolith



Lunar 1D Thermal Model Components
=================================

ensemble.f90: (main program)
	produces an ensemble of lunar surface temperature time series (for
	thermal properties determination)

flux_moon.f90:
	insolation on lunar surface according to Keihm (1984), which is also
	used in the Standard Diviner Thermal Model (Hayne et al. 2017)

soilthprop_moon.f90:
	thermal properties of lunar surface layer



makefile:
	shows file dependencies
