Irradiance models for terrestrial analogs
=========================================

sunpos.f90:
	position of the Sun from location on Earth

mk_atmosphere.f90:
	subroutine for 1D atmosphere for Mauna Kea

insol_earth.f90: (main program)
	short-wavelength irradiance with topography

insol_flat.f90: (main program)
	calculates short-wavelength solar irradiance at flat location
	on Earth; analogues to insol_earth.f90

(several symoblic links to subroutines in Topo3D/)

makefile:
	shows file dependencies
