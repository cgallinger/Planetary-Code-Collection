Irradiance models for terrestrial analogs
=========================================

sunpos.f90:
	position of the Sun from location on Earth

mk_atmosphere.f90:
	subroutine for 1D atmosphere for Mauna Kea

insol_earth.f90:
	main program; short-wavelength irradiance with topography

insol_flat.f90:
	main program; calculates short-wavelength solar irradiance
	at flat location on Earth analogues to insol_earth.f90

cratersQ_earth_static.f90:
 	main program; calculates SW insolation with shadowing and reflections  
       with Mauna Kea atmosphere; static solution with mean insolation

(several symoblic links to subroutines in Topo3D/)

makefile:
	shows file dependencies
