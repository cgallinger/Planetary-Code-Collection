Irradiance models for terrestrial analogs
=========================================

(in progress)

sunpos.f90:
	position of the Sun from location on Earth

mk_atmosphere.f90:
	subroutine for 1D atmosphere for Mauna Kea

insol_earth.f90:
	main program; short-wavelength irradiance with topography

makefile:
	shows file dependencies



To compile in a single directory, you might want to copy subroutines from Craters/.
